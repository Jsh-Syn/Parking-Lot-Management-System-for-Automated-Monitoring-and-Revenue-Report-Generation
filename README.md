# Parking Lot Management System for Automated Monitoring and Revenue Report Generation

Welcome! In this project, I am the project manager, software tester, and UI designer. I am the one responsible for supervising the whole process of the entire Capstone Project 1 & 2. This includes the documentation and system development phase.

This system is developed in order to provide an IT solution for the Metro Parking Management (Phils,). Inc. Santa Rosa Branch since their business operations are done manually. By creating a system tailored for automating the monitoring of vehicles and revenue report generation, the parking lot can avoid a lot of problems including the human-errors, recordkeeping, and human resource allocation.

By using the same color scheme that the client's website is currently using, I've decided to take a minimalistic approach by using the same color scheme but improving it and making it look more modern and presentable.

## Software(s) used in the making of the design:

- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator

## Software(s) used in making the system and documentation:

- Visual Studio
- SQL Server Management Studio 19
- Microsoft Word (Documentation)
